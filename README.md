### Library for reading the sensors off a yoctopuce
temperature, humidity, pressure sensor USB stick

The library publishes the data onto a zmq pub bus
and its sent out to various interested parties (storage, live plotting etc)

TODO:

* generalize code
* add some command line options: list of sensors, which boxes, publish port
